[Daniel Cavero - Website](http://dancavero.com)

This website acts as a resume/CV/profile. In it I will hopefully have documented and exhibited the most prominent projects during my carreer. It is an ongoing project itself that I am using to learn coding and web developement. 


I used a site template I found on the internet. Below is posted the readme.txt file that came with the template. It is easy to use and open source!

A dark, slick, modern, responsive, adjective-drenched design built around an extremely
dynamic landing page (scroll that mofo!). Inspired by Big Picture, another design
of mine with a similarish feel/flow, only this time I took it waaaaaay further and
actually made it multipurpose (versus copping out and making it a one pager like I
did last time ;) Includes multiple pages, a bunch of pre-styled elements, and all
its Sass sources.
