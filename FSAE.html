								<h3>Introduction </h3>
								<p>Being the Suspension Lead for the Aztec Racing team was one of the best learning opportunities in my career. Teaming up with a group of passionate and talented engineers who dedicated countless hours towards a shared goal can be a most rewarding experince. </p>
								<p>I gained valuable experience in the field of formula car suspension and steering design, manufacturing of fiber composite parts, engine tuning, data acquisition, power transmission, rapid prototyping, and engine air intake design. As Suspension Lead I also learned how to successfully manage a team and organize a large scaled engineering project in coalescence with other project leads.</p>

											<h3>Suspension Design</h3>
											<p>After analyzing the performance of the AR12 (the previous Aztec Racing car), it was clear that the main issue with its design was the lack of predictability felt by the driver. Combining hand measurements taken directly from the 2012 car, and measurement from CAD models, a model was created in WinGeo3, a suspension analysis software. It was concluded that this lack of predictability was due to high (16in) center of gravity (CG), roll center movement during roll, large scrub radius, and large changes in camber during roll. The AR13 was designed mainly with the goal of correcting these issues. We were also able to include other design features that increased its breaking power, turning force, overall reliability and reduced its weight.The following is a graphs produced by the WinGeo3 suspension software comparing the AR12’s and the AR13’s vertical roll center (RC) change during roll. This is the most important change made to the design. </p>

											<h3>Fabrication</h3>
											<p> Masks were designed in Coventorware (MEMS design sofware) after the final geometry was defined and sent to a third party to print. A lithographic procedure was designed and the devices were fabricated in the SDSU MEMS Cleanroom. The process included spin coating, masking, UV expsures, and chemical etching in sonicators. SEM and ligh microscope analysis was carried out to ensure trace quality between process design iterations. The image above shows a PDMS and a Polyimide device being etched. </p>

										<h3>Sensing Principle</h3>
										<p>The device works by taking advantage of the relatively linear temperature coefficient of resistance [α]  of platinum. This property causes the increse in electrical resistivity as the temperature increases. The equation bellow is used to calculate resitivity [R] at [T] using a reference resistivity, temperature and the termperature coefficient of resististance. </p>

										<p></p>
										<h3>Bio-integration</h3>
										<p>The sensor was designed to be placed on the skin like a tatto. For long term use, this meant the material used to enclose the sensor had to be skin compatible both biologicaly and mechanically. A material had to chosen that prenvented rashes or undesirable sking complications and would also behave like the skin to make it comfortable to wear. PDMS, a stretchable biocompatible material was selected for device enclosure. Polyimide was used for prototypes and testing.</p>
										<h3>Finite Element Analysis</h3>
										<p>Using a combination of SolidWorks and COMSOL, iterations were made to find the optimal geometry of the platinum metal trace taking into account the flexibility of the device.The X-spring shape allowed for the device to stretch and bend with the skin without overstressing the platinum sensor.</p>
										<h3>Testing</h3>
										<p>The device was tested by placing it on a volunteers hand and having them stretch and flex. The device was then mounted onto a test bench on a hotplate where the resistance value was recorded as its temperature increased and measured. Results, plotted below, were in line with sensing principles.The image shows the device on the hotplate connected to micro-probes measuring the resistance. The temperature was being monitored with a laser thermometer. </p>
