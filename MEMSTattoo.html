											<h3>Project Overview </h3>
											<p>A biocompatible tattoo-like skin temperature sensor able to be safely placed on the skin was designed and fabricated. The design, studied by Finite Elements Analysis, allowed the sensor to stretch and bend like skin, making it very comfortable to wear. My team, whom I was the leader of, was one of two out of ten groups to have a final working prototype, manufactured by us in a MEMS cleanroom using lithographic techniques. The proyect was carried out in two weeks. </p>

											<h3>Fabrication</h3>
											<p> Masks were designed in Coventorware (MEMS design sofware) after the final geometry was defined and sent to a third party to print. A lithographic procedure was designed and the devices were fabricated in the SDSU MEMS Cleanroom. The process included spin coating, masking, UV expsures, and chemical etching in sonicators. SEM and ligh microscope analysis was carried out to ensure trace quality between process design iterations. The image above shows a PDMS and a Polyimide device being etched. </p>

										<h3>Sensing Principle</h3>
										<p>The device works by taking advantage of the relatively linear temperature coefficient of resistance [Î±]  of platinum. This property causes the increse in electrical resistivity as the temperature increases. The equation bellow is used to calculate resitivity [R] at [T] using a reference resistivity, temperature and the termperature coefficient of resististance. </p>

										<h3>Bio-integration</h3>
										<p>The sensor was designed to be placed on the skin like a tatto. For long term use, this meant the material used to enclose the sensor had to be skin compatible both biologicaly and mechanically. A material had to chosen that prenvented rashes or undesirable sking complications and would also behave like the skin to make it comfortable to wear. PDMS, a stretchable biocompatible material was selected for device enclosure. Polyimide was used for prototypes and testing.</p>
										<h3>Finite Element Analysis</h3>
										<p>Using a combination of SolidWorks and COMSOL, iterations were made to find the optimal geometry of the platinum metal trace taking into account the flexibility of the device.The X-spring shape allowed for the device to stretch and bend with the skin without overstressing the platinum sensor.</p>
										<h3>Testing</h3>
										<p>The device was tested by placing it on a volunteers hand and having them stretch and flex. The device was then mounted onto a test bench on a hotplate where the resistance value was recorded as its temperature increased and measured. Results, plotted below, were in line with sensing principles.The image shows the device on the hotplate connected to micro-probes measuring the resistance. The temperature was being monitored with a laser thermometer. </p>
